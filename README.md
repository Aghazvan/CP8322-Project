# CP8322-Project
This project is inspired1 by the Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge (https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020/task). The aim of this project is to replicate the central claim in a selected computer vision paper. This will include re-implementing the core methods and experiments in the paper. Importantly, your outcome can be positive (i.e., the results are reproducible) or negative (i.e., explain what was not reproducible and attempt to explain why this is the case). Keep in mind that not all results in papers are reproducible for a variety of reasons, e.g., missing details and (gasp) bugs in the code.
The project can be done in teams of at most three with the expectations of the project scope increased accordingly. The course does not provide any compute resources (GPU). Fortunately, there are a variety of free (but lim- ited) online compute resources available, see https://paperswithcode.com/ rc2020/resources. Please keep this strongly in mind in the selection of your project. The project consists of four parts: (i) paper selection, (ii) proposal, (iii) report, and (iv) code.
